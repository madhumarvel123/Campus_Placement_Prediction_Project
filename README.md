# Campus_Placement_Prediction_Project
1. The project focuses on developing a system that utilizes historical student records to predict the placement outcomes of students enrolled in different educational institutions. By analyzing the placement status of past students, educational institutions can make informed forecasts about future placement trends.
   
2. The number of admissions each year correlates directly with the quality of placements offered by the institution, motivating every educational establishment to enhance its placement cell. This endeavor benefits both students and the institution alike, offering valuable support throughout their academic and professional journeys.
